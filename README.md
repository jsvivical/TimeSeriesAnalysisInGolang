# TimeSeriesAnalysisInGolang

I'm trying to make a library when analyzing time series.
Since I'm not used to statistics, it may take a long time to complete it.

What I'm going to add
1.revise Brown-quardratic exponential smoothing
2.Halt's two parameter linear exponential smoothing
3.Winters' multiplicative seasonal exponential smoothing
4.Winters' additive seasonal exponential smoothing
5.ACF
6.PACF
7.AR model
8.ARMA model 
9.ARIMA model
